So, I'm taken the time and effort to actually connect to the NHL API...but I have no idea how I did that. 

So I sort of want to refresh myself. I want to recall what I've actually done, and how I've done it. Because it's pretty cool. And I want to be able to explore more with it. And especially since I've got it in a Rails app already, why can't I do something with it? 

I mean, I should be able to play with this...so do it. See what else I can do. 

One thing that I've noted is that it is up to date... I mean, I pulled up the one webpage I have for it, and there's players there already. I had the Blackhawks roster programmed, and it's up to date. Which is pretty fucking cool.

So that is actually really encouraging. 

So now that I'm learning about routes again, and I already have this thing up and running, I sort of want to figure out how to do more with routes, and consuming this API at the same time. 

But before I try to do more, I want to know what I've already done. 

so where would I look? I mean, I could look at...routes.rb obviously! lol. since that's what I'm learning about. 

Ok, that's hilarious...I only have the one route. 

So that's a place to start for me. I only have one route, because I don't know what else I might want to be doing. Like, I don't know what other resources I might have. 

but I know that I do have access to the NHL API...the next thing is...how can I get to the point of having another route. 

Like, what would be another route that I'd want to have? And what would it do? 

So for me to answer that, I'd need to learn more about routes. But just keep this in mind as I continue to learn about routes. And see if I can make some sort of connection between building routes to hard coded resources, and building routes to API resources. 

Ok, so I'm learning that a lot of what I want to be looking at is a little beyond simple articles; Like, there won't be an article about how to use the NHL API...so maybe I should write it! 

And through the writing, I'll find what I do and don't know. And that much will be revealed. Adn then if there are easier ways to do things, those also will be revealed. 

Finally, I have some sort of topic for my blog. So with that in mind, I should go ahead and begin writing an article for that.
